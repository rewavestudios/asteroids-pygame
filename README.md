# Asteroids Game

We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). 

Prerequisites:
* Python 3.10+ installed;
* Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash).

We are going to be using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) and a virtual environment ([venv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) to develop our game.

The [pygame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/pygame.html) will be super useful throughout this project.
